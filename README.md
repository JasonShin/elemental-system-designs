# What is this?

Elemental System Designs is an open source project to document system architecture design of popular apps and open source projects that we want to imagine its internals. The project focuses on the high level abstraction architecture based on use cases of an app that we can observe while using them in real life.

We will focus on features with high-impact of the selected apps, while proposing high scalable and resilient architecture that could scale infinitely. We welcome anyone who is actually in the same field as the app of proposed architecture to give us ideas around industry specific bottlenecks and your solution to the problem.

# What is System Design?

System Architecture Design, often called System Design is a conceptual representation of the components and subcomponents that reflects the behaviour of the system as a whole.

System Architects are who make decisions on components to use based on the use cases and requirements given by the business, and consider trade-offs and bottleneck while designing a system.

> What I cannot create, I do not understand. â€” Richard Feynman

I am writing this project for me to better understand system architecture of various popular apps that I use daily. While the system design proposals are hypothetical, we bring industry best practices in the proposals, and have them available for anyone who is interested in pursuing the field of system architecture designs as references.

I believe a good architecture is the key to delivering a successful project. A good architecture is required even if you are building a side project or a system for a company while being paid. Once a good architecture is available in front of you well documented, you are more confident and faster as a programmer to hit the deadline of delivering an application (or even a feature within a large ecosystem).
